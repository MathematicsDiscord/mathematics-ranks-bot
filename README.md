### Key Features

**üß† Intelligent Help Channel Management:**

The bot facilitates a structured onboarding process for new contributors. When a user first attempts to post in a help thread, their message is preemptively removed, and they are privately sent the "Helper Guidelines". The "Volunteer Helper" role is granted only upon their agreement to these terms.
The system provides complete lifecycle management for help threads, which includes sending automated reminders for inactivity and executing automatic closure if the thread creator leaves the server or deletes their initial message.

**‚≠ê Progressive Ranking System:**

Members accrue points when they receive a "thank" from the user they have assisted at the time a thread is closed. The system features a configurable daily point cap to prevent helper burnout and automatically assigns role rewards based on reaching predefined point thresholds.
Once all standard volunteer ranks are achieved, a helper becomes eligible to apply for more prestigious roles (e.g., Verified Helper, Certified Helper) through an integrated application system. These applications are sent to a private staff-only channel for review, which includes an interface for accepting or declining and providing direct feedback. An accepted application unlocks further opportunities for rank progression.

**üìä Data Analytics & Leaderboards:**

The /tophelpers command presents a paginated leaderboard with all-time, monthly, and weekly statistical breakdowns. It also dynamically generates bar graphs to visualize top helpers' points and their activity across different help channels (e.g., School vs. University).

###  Installation and Setup

Before you can begin setting up the bot, you'll need to make sure you have the following:
1. Node.js (v16.9.0 or higher recommended)
2. Git
3. A MySQL database server.

First, you'll need to run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MathematicsDiscord/mathematics-ranks-bot.git
cd <the place where you cloned the git repo>
npm install
```

and then, we'll have to get the database for the bot set up and connected.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE ranking_bot;
```

> **Note:** if you don't have MySQL, follow this [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=455KKhZyvow) to set it up.

### Environment Configuration

The next step is to create a new text document, make sure to name it ```.env```, and you can use the following template for its contents:

```env

### Creating the Discord Bot

1. Navigate to the [Discord Developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) in your web browser.
2. Log in with your Discord account.
3. Click the "New Application" button in the top-right corner.
4. Give your application a name. This will be the initial name of the bot. For example: Mathematics Rank Bot.
5. Agree to the Discord Developer Terms of Service and click "Create".
6. Find the "Application ID". This is a long number.
7. Click the "Copy" button next to it.
8. Paste this value into your .env file for the CLIENT_ID variable.

```env
CLIENT_ID=YOUR_APPLICATION_ID_HERE
```

9. In the navigation menu on the left, click on the "Bot" tab.
10. You will see your bot's username and icon.
11. Find the section titled "Token" and click the "Reset Token" button.
12. Confirm by clicking "Yes, do it!".
13. Click the "Copy" button to copy the token to your clipboard, and immediately paste this value into your .env file for the TOKEN variable.

```env
TOKEN=YOUR_SECRET_BOT_TOKEN_HERE
```

14. On the "Bot" page, scroll down to the "Privileged Gateway Intents" section.
You must enable the following three intents:
‚úÖ SERVER MEMBERS INTENT
‚úÖ MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT
15. In the navigation menu, go to the "OAuth2" tab, and then click on the "URL Generator" sub-tab.
In the "Scopes" box, select the following:
‚úÖ bot
‚úÖ applications.commands
16. A new "Bot Permissions" box will appear below. For this bot to function correctly, it needs a wide range of permissions to manage roles, channels, messages, and threads.
For the simplest setup, select "Administrator". This grants the bot all necessary permissions.
(For advanced users: If you prefer not to grant Administrator, you must manually select all permissions related to managing channels, managing threads, sending messages, managing roles, and reading message history.)
17. A generated URL will appear at the bottom of the page. Click the "Copy" button.
Paste this URL into your browser, select the server you want to add the bot to from the dropdown menu, and click "Authorize".
18. To get the bot running, just type:
```bash
node index.js
```
Or
```bash
nohup node index.js &
```
